# Challenge 2, CSS: Personal Portfolio Project

## Page Description and Explanation:

This page was originally created as a homework assignment for a coding bootcamp through the Univeristy of Minnesota. It is intended to function as a personal portfolio to show the work I've done. The header bar at the top of the page contains my name, as well as working links to different sections on the page: "work", "about me", "contact me", and "resume". Below that is a section that will give light background information about me, as well as a profile picture of me to the right. Currently there is no information in the 'about me' section, as I am uncomfortable writing about myself and have been putting it off. 

Below this is the 'work' section of the page. The first third is dedicated to the prework application. There is a large image of the application, and when you hover over it a caption appears with the words "prework application". When you click on the image, it takes you to the live prework site. Below that, to the right of the page, is an image of the challenge 1 application. Like the previous, if you hover over the image a caption appears with the words "challenge1 application". If you click on the image, it brings you to the live challenge1 site. To the left of this is a placeholder image with the words "coming soon!". As I create more applications, I will replace it with one of those. 

Below the 'work' section is the 'resume' section. Like the 'about me' section, this is currently blank. At the very bottom of the page is a footer with the 'contact me' section. It currently reads: "Email", "Phone number" and "Other?". I have not attached my personal information to these options yet. Obviously the 'other?' option will also be replaced.

## Credits
All of the code was written by me. However, a tutor through the University of Minnesota provided very helpful feedback on convincing the different image elements on the page to resize to different screen sizes while not overlapping.
